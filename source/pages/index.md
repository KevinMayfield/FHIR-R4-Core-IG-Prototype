This is the initial FHIR R4 Demo Core Implementation Guide, Version 1.0.0.  

**Important:**

This Core specification is in the **Discovery** stage based on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery" target="_blank">GDS agile delivery</a>. It is an initial Core specification **for demonstration purposes only**. 

It is also intended to demonstrate a proposed approach to generating a UK Core specification, using the <a href="https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=IG_Publisher_Documentation" target="_blank">HL7 IG Publisher tool</a>.

The approach documented here is currently being evaluated and discussed with parties who are actively involved NHS Digital programmes, such as maternity.

Nothing contained in this Core specification should be implemented or proposed as a solution to vendors. 

For queries and comments please email the <a href="mailto:interoperabilityteam@nhs.net?subject=FHIR%STU3%Core%20Specification">Interoperability Team</a>.

Issues can be reported on the <a href="https://github.com/nhsconnect/FHIR-R4-Core-IG-1.0.0/issues" target="_blank">FHIR-R4-Core-IG-1.0.0 GitHub repository</a>.
